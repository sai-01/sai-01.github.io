## About Me

My name is Yunlong Tang (<a id="about-me" href='https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&text=%E5%94%90%E4%BA%91%E9%BE%99'><i class="fa fa-volume-up" aria-hidden="true" style="color:deeppink;"></i></a>). 
I'm a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/) (UR), advised by [Prof. Chenliang Xu](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~cxu22/index.html). 
Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech) under the supervision of [Prof. Feng Zheng](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/fengzheng/en). 
I was a machine learning research intern at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/) Data Platform, worked with the mentors Ms. Qin Lin and [Dr. Wenhao Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rAlT64IAAAAJ&hl=en).

My recent research mainly lies in **Multimodal AI** and **Video Understanding**. Additionally, I have a keen interest in AI Agent, Generative and Interactive AI.
